# EmbeddedDesignFinal
The repository holding the C++ code for my Embedded Design final

See <a href="https://gajjara.github.io/embedded_design/">my portfolio page</a> on this project.

The main code used for the complete operation is in the assign6 folder.

Note that credit goes to the Embedded Design teaching faculty of Northeastern University for some of the development of the code.
